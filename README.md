## Overview
The purpose of this project is to simulate signals from an EEG signal source to investigate
the possibililty of using the Atmega328p MCU to process signals from a signal 
generator. The signal generator sends signals to a MCP3008 Analog to Digital Converter,
which sends a 10-bit digital representation via SPI protocol to the MCU.    

## Development Roadmap
The h/w project is comprised of the following activities 
i) Process signals using Atmega328p and MCP3008 and investigate the ability to
provide good sampling data for use in high resolution displays.

ii) Add pre-amplification h/w to replace the signal generator bio-signals from
    bio-source electrodes.
    
iii) Add FFT processing to display freqeuncy amplitudes.
               
 		
     
## Measurements
TBD
- discussion of relevant metrics to indicate the robustness, reliability and accuracy
of this MCU configuration.
